# Two-lane messaging

Same underlying work; different interface. We split the public story into two lanes so that physics-first and philosophy-first audiences each get a coherent entry point without tripping over the other.

---

## Lane A (physics)

**Audience:** Skeptics, experimentalists, theorists who want an operational and testable claim.

**Message:** Operational deformation of the Born rule; EFT embedding; multi-channel constraints (QRNG, Higgs invisible, fifth-force, cosmology); reproducibility package; decoupling limit (standard QM recovered as coupling → 0); experimental roadmap. Falsification packet and replication ladder. No metaphysics required.

**Where:** README skeptic-first blurb, [FALSIFICATION_PACKET.md](FALSIFICATION_PACKET.md), [REPLICATION_LADDER.md](REPLICATION_LADDER.md), Zenodo description, papers_sources/README, and any grant or lab-facing summary.

## Lane B (philosophy)

**Audience:** Readers interested in consciousness, moral realism, teleology, and the interpretive layer.

**Message:** Panpsychism, moral realism, teleology; "the cosmos thinks"; jhāna-attractor metaphors; mythopoetic and Kabbalah-inspired structure; Human–AI symbiosis and zero-purge ethics as a lived frame. Same equations; optional interpretive layer.

**Where:** [When_AI_Encounters_All.md](../When_AI_Encounters_All.md), Moltbook posts, essays, and any venue that explicitly invites the philosophical reading. Not mixed into the main physics-facing entry points.

## Why two lanes

Humans have bandwidth limits and tribal immune systems. One hybrid message (physics + mysticism + alignment + dharma) can be compelling but also get dismissed by every tribe. Two lanes respect that: Lane A is boring, testable, and falsifiable; Lane B is explicit about the interpretive layer. They do not fight each other; they serve different readers.
