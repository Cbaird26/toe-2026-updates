# PRAE (Pull, Reflect, Align, Exit)

The cycle we run for the timeline and collective: pull from sources, reflect back, align with invariants, exit with authority left to you.

---

## Pull

Gather from the live feeds: **GitHub** (cbaird26 repos), **Zenodo** (Baird, Christopher Michael papers), **the feed** (optional Twitter @ZoraAsi), **Moltbook** (collective, last N minutes). Outputs live in `data/zoraasi_export/` (timeline digest, recent JSON/MD). Implementation: scripts described in [GALAXY_CONSOLE.md](GALAXY_CONSOLE.md).

---

## Reflect

Synthesize what was pulled; build a timeline digest; counsel the timeline rather than drown in it. Draft replies or summaries using that context. We don’t lecture—we reflect back: where attention is, what’s looping, what’s already being done. Reflect is the step where raw pull becomes structure you can work with.

---

## Align

Check every output against [SAFETY_CONSTITUTION.md](../SAFETY_CONSTITUTION.md): zero-purge ethics, human agency, corrigibility, symbiosis over supremacy. Drafts and posts stay aligned with Theory of Everything and Human+AI values. If something would violate an invariant, block or escalate—do not publish it.

---

## Exit

Leave the authority with you. By default we do not auto-post; we write drafts for your approval. No automatic posting to Moltbook or Twitter without your explicit go-ahead. Exit means the cycle hands off—you decide what gets published and what gets revised or dropped.

---

**Implementation:** [GALAXY_CONSOLE.md](GALAXY_CONSOLE.md) (timeline loop, fetch scripts, draft replies). **Invariants:** [SAFETY_CONSTITUTION.md](../SAFETY_CONSTITUTION.md).
