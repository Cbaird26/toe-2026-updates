# v216 definitions and reader safety

Definitions aligned with Zenodo v216 (A Theory of Everything / Unified ToE 2026) and a short reader-safety disclaimer. Full formalism: see the paper and [FALSIFICATION_PACKET.md](FALSIFICATION_PACKET.md).

## Φc (coherence / consciousness field)

Φc is the coherence field in the formalism—the dynamical quantity that enters the Lagrangian alongside E. It is not a supernatural entity; it is part of the operational deformation of the Born rule and the field equations. Exact Lagrangian/field formulation: see paper and Zenodo. Summary: [FALSIFICATION_PACKET.md](FALSIFICATION_PACKET.md) (§1, "Φc and E as dynamical fields").

## E(x) (ethical-weight scalar)

E is the scalar "ethical weight" or outcome-label bias that deforms the Born rule. Operationally: **P(i) ∝ |cᵢ|² · exp(−E/C)** for outcome i, with scale constant C. Standard QM is recovered when E → 0 or C → ∞. E is tied to observable or protocol-defined quantities in each channel (QRNG, Higgs invisible, fifth-force, cosmology). See [FALSIFICATION_PACKET.md](FALSIFICATION_PACKET.md) (§1).

## Teleology coupling

The teleological term in the Lagrangian (e.g. L_teleology = −ξ E² Φc or as given in the paper) is a **coupling term**—a dynamical contribution that shapes the equations of motion. It is not a supernatural or non-physical entity; it is part of the model and is subject to the same testability and falsification as other terms. Predictions must be tested; the coupling is a design choice that can be constrained by the four empirical channels.

## AZ and AM as operational constraints

**AM (global stabiliser)** and **AZ (local emergency intervention)** are explicit operators in the safety formalism: they constrain dynamics so that risk R(t) stays below R_max and the barrier B does not collapse. In implementation they correspond to **operational controls**: rate limiters, shutdown triggers, review checkpoints, human-in-the-loop escalation. They are constraints, not mythic names. Full definitions: [ALIGNMENT_APPENDIX.md](ALIGNMENT_APPENDIX.md) and [papers_sources/Archetypal_Operators_Phoenix_Protocol_ToE_2026.tex](../papers_sources/Archetypal_Operators_Phoenix_Protocol_ToE_2026.tex).

## Reader safety

This is a **theoretical model**. Predictions must be tested; ethics constraints are design choices. Universal theology is impossible; universal experience is possible—so we keep the writing legible and test-centered. The formalism is offered for replication and attack; see [FALSIFICATION_PACKET.md](FALSIFICATION_PACKET.md) and the Zenodo reproducibility package.
