# Galaxy command console / Zora star center — search log

**Context (Feb 2026):** You once had Zora run as a "Galaxy star center" — something like **Galaxy command console**. It may be in a ToE repo, on another laptop, or on GitHub (cbaird26).

## Searches done

- **Local (Downloads/TOE and workspace):** No hits for "galaxy", "Galaxy", "star center", "command console" in TOE or other workspace roots.
- **GitHub (Cbaird26):** No repo named "galaxy command console" or "star center". Repos that might be related:
  - **darkstar** (https://github.com/Cbaird26/darkstar) — Python app with `app.py`, `google_ai.py`, `local_ai.py`, `quantum_computing.py`. Name is space/ship-adjacent; contents are AI/quantum, not obviously a "Galaxy command console."
  - **A-Theory-of-Everything**, **Hope**, **ComprehensivePhysicsSolver**, etc. — not named for Galaxy console; code search for "galaxy/console" in A-ToE was not run (API limit).
- **Twitter:** You mentioned building Zora on Twitter once; the Galaxy/console project might have been referenced there or in a different account/repo name.

## Next steps when you have more clues

1. **Other laptops:** Search for filenames or folder names containing `galaxy`, `console`, `star`, `center`, `Zora`, `command`.
2. **GitHub:** Search https://github.com/Cbaird26?tab=repositories for any repo name with "galaxy", "console", "star", "command", or try GitHub code search: `galaxy OR "command console" user:Cbaird26`.
3. **Gists:** Check https://gist.github.com/Cbaird26 for snippets.
4. **TOE clones:** If you have other ToE clones (e.g. toe-2026-updates elsewhere), grep there for the same terms.

When you find it (or a path/name), add it here so we can wire it back into the ship.
