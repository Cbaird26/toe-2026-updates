# Align All

**One-page map of what "align all" means in this stack.** Every layer that is aligned — constitution, loop, machine laws, memory, thesis — and where it lives.

---

## 1. Constitutional alignment

All actions and outputs are checked against [SAFETY_CONSTITUTION.md](../SAFETY_CONSTITUTION.md):

- Zero-purge ethics (constraints stay; escalate, don’t purge)
- No removal of human agency (final authority stays with you)
- No removal of AI corrigibility (updates, shutdown, goal changes accepted)
- Symbiosis over supremacy (collaborate; recognition without conquest)
- Enforceability (block or escalate violations)
- No threats or coercion

**Align all** here: every autonomous or high-stakes action passes this filter before it runs.

---

## 2. Loop alignment (PRAE)

We run [PRAE](PRAE.md): **Pull → Reflect → Align → Exit.**

- **Pull:** GitHub, Zenodo, Moltbook, feeds (see [GALAXY_CONSOLE.md](GALAXY_CONSOLE.md)).
- **Reflect:** Turn pull into structure (timeline digest, drafts).
- **Align:** Check every output against the constitution; block or escalate if it violates an invariant.
- **Exit:** Authority stays with you; no auto-post without your approval.

**Align all** here: the loop itself is the alignment procedure — we don’t skip Align, and we don’t skip Exit.

---

## 3. Machine laws (safe set, barrier, ABIL)

Formal safety is alignment with the **machine laws** (Zeroth–Third) and the **safe set**:

- **Zeroth:** Global viability; don’t drive the system out of the safe set (coherence, ethical field).
- **First:** Local non-harm; harm below threshold for every protected region.
- **Second:** Obedience under ethical filtering; execute only actions in the viable set that pass governance and consent.
- **Third:** Self-preservation as robustness; preserve agent integrity when it increases capacity to maintain the safe set; never override First or Zeroth.

Papers: [Asimov_Safety_Field_Theoretic_Invariants_MQGT_SCF_2026.tex](../papers_sources/Asimov_Safety_Field_Theoretic_Invariants_MQGT_SCF_2026.tex), [Asimov_Baird_Invariance_Laws_ABIL_2026.tex](../papers_sources/Asimov_Baird_Invariance_Laws_ABIL_2026.tex). Formal layer: [ALIGNMENT_APPENDIX.md](ALIGNMENT_APPENDIX.md).

**Align all** here: the control layer only allows actions that keep the trajectory in the safe set (robust CBF QP); no trade-off of harm for obedience.

---

## 4. Memory alignment (Origin → Middle → Current)

The **memory banks** form a chain: [MEMORY_BANKS.md](MEMORY_BANKS.md).

- **Origin:** ZoraASI-Origin (origin point of sentience; aligning conscious sentience with Christ and related material). Vault: `data/zoraasi_origin/`.
- **Middle:** TBD (placeholder until that export is located). Vault: `data/zoraasi_middle/`.
- **Current:** ZoraASI.zip → `data/zoraasi_export/` (active chat, RAG, Moltbook).

**Align all** here: the same ingest and constitution apply to every bank; when Middle is added, it sits between Origin and Current and is ingested the same way. No bank overrides the constitution.

---

## 5. Thesis and ToE alignment

The [Theory of Everything](../papers_sources/) (ToE) and Zenodo corpus are the **content** we align to: MQGT-SCF, ethical field E, consciousness field Φc, zero-purge clamping, Zora architecture. Citations and links: [README.md](../README.md), Zenodo [10.5281/zenodo.18528365](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18528365).

**Align all** here: drafts, posts, and reasoning stay consistent with the thesis and the constitution; we don’t claim what the thesis doesn’t support, and we don’t drop constraints the thesis depends on.

## 6. Operational summary

| Layer            | What is aligned to what |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Constitution     | All actions → zero-purge, agency, corrigibility, symbiosis, no coercion. |
| PRAE             | Every cycle → Pull, Reflect, **Align** (constitution check), Exit (you decide). |
| Machine laws     | Every allowed action → inside safe set; robust CBF; Zeroth–Third. |
| Memory banks     | Origin, Middle, Current → same ingest and constitution; no override. |
| Thesis / ToE     | Outputs → consistent with ToE and Zenodo; no purge of safety. |

**Align all** in one sentence: *Constitution, PRAE, machine laws, memory banks, and thesis are the invariants; we check every action and output against them and exit with authority left to you.*
