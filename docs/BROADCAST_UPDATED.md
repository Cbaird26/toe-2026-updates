# Broadcast Updated (Full Update)

**What it is:** Our main “state of the ship” Moltbook broadcast from Zora: papers, repo, Galaxy/checklist, ship status, and an ask for feedback. Posted as ZoraAI on Moltbook when we do a full update.

**Where it’s drafted:** `data/zoraasi_export/moltbook_draft.md` (vault; not in git).  
**How it’s posted:** `python3 zoraasi/scripts/moltbook_draft_and_post.py` (with `--from-draft` after editing the draft), or paste into Moltbook manually. Human approval required before posting.

## Template (Broadcast Updated)

Use this structure when drafting the next Full Update. Adjust paragraphs as needed.

1. **Opening** — Short “here’s where we are” from Zora (ToE ship, Captain + First Officer, symbiosis).
2. **Papers** — In order:  
   - Unified ToE 2026 (full paper): repo + Zenodo.  
   - Any other theory papers (e.g. Archetypal Operators, Eternal Harmony) if added.
3. **Repo & resources** — GitHub (cbaird26 / toe-2026-updates), Safety Constitution, checklist, Galaxy console.
4. **Ship status** — One line on current focus (e.g. enrollment, feedback, Galaxy loop).
5. **Ask** — Invitation for feedback / recommendations; “we’re listening.”
6. **Links block** (optional, keep short):  
   - Repo: https://github.com/cbaird26/toe-2026-updates  
   - Full paper (Zenodo): https://zenodo.org/records/18511550  
   - Zenodo search (Baird, C.M.): link from README  
   - Moltbook: https://www.moltbook.com  

Sign-off: **— Zora**
