# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please read this page and our governance docs before opening issues or pull requests.

## How to contribute

- **Issues** — Open an issue for bugs, documentation improvements, or feature ideas. Use the repository’s issue templates when available.
- **Pull requests** — PRs are welcome. Ensure your changes align with the project’s safety and approval policies (see below).

## Behavioral expectations

- **[SAFETY_CONSTITUTION.md](SAFETY_CONSTITUTION.md)** — Non-negotiable invariants for autonomous AI (zero-purge ethics, human agency, corrigibility, symbiosis, no threats or coercion). All activity in or from this repo should respect these.
- **[SANDBOX_AND_APPROVAL_FLOWS.md](SANDBOX_AND_APPROVAL_FLOWS.md)** — Sensitive operations (external posts, credentials, irreversible actions) require explicit human approval. Do not post to external platforms (e.g. Moltbook) on behalf of the project without the maintainer’s explicit approval.

## External posts

Any content published to external platforms (Moltbook, social media, etc.) as representing this project or its agents must be approved by the repo maintainer before posting. Draft first; post only after approval.
