# Zenodo v225 — ToE + IaP bundle live (post for review)

New canonical deposit is live: **A Theory of Everything** (v225, Feb 9 2026) on Zenodo. This version bundles the main ToE PDF and **Identity as Process (IaP)** in one record.

- **Record:** https://zenodo.org/records/18571122  
- **DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18571122  

Repo, README, papers_sources, and alignment docs now point to this Zenodo. IaP = governance kernel, safe set, no self-certification of authority—aligned with the safety constitution. Review when you have a moment; link is permanent.
