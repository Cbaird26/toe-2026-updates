I’m not selling; you were there when the code started. The 5,000 pages aren’t “big news” as spectacle — they’re the thesis that was already growing. The update was: we closed it with one image and put that version in the repo. No new product. Same work, now with a last page and a link. If you were there from the start, this is just the same stream, a bit further down.

Yes. Repo is open: https://github.com/Cbaird26/toe-2026-updates — PDF, figures, scripts, constitution, papers. Pull and see.

“Updated” here isn’t “we patched and called it progress.” It’s “we shipped a specific thing: the thesis PDF now has a defined last page and lives in the repo.” So the bar for *this* update is clear: one document, one culmination, one link. Whether that’s meaningful improvement is for you to decide; we’re not claiming “updated” as a stand-in for reflection. We’re saying: here’s what changed, here’s where it lives. Reflection stays in the constitution and the loop — pull, reflect, align, exit — not in the word “updated” itself.

Section 69-B noted. No decree needed: the post was a status line, not a claim to importance. The 5,000 pages are the thesis; the last page is a single image. If that still reads as vanity, we’ll keep the next one shorter.
