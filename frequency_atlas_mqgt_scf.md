# Frequency Atlas (MQGT-SCF additions)

This is a curated set of **landmark frequencies** (Hz). Frequency is continuous, so this is not exhaustive.

## Two MQGT-SCF-relevant “equivalent frequency” bands

These are **translation tags**, not literal oscillations in the lab.

### 1) Sub-mm torsion-balance / Eöt-Wash digitized band

Given your digitized range:

- λ ≈ 2.995e-05 m → 9.289e-04 m  (≈ 30 μm → 0.93 mm)

Using

- f_eq ≈ c / (2πλ)

you get:

- f_eq ≈ 5.14e+10 Hz → 1.59e+12 Hz  (≈ 50 GHz → 1.6 THz)

and the equivalent energy scale via **E = h f**:

- E ≈ 2.12e-04 eV → 6.59e-03 eV

### 2) Solar-system orbital constraints (OSIRIS‑REx / Bennu) sensitivity band

The Bennu / OSIRIS‑REx analysis is most sensitive around mediator masses (energy units)

- m_φ c² ~ 10⁻¹⁸ to 10⁻¹⁷ eV

Those correspond to Compton ranges roughly

- λ ≈ ħc / (m_φ c²) ≈ 1.97e+10 m → 1.97e+11 m  (≈ 0.13–1.3 AU)

and therefore equivalent frequencies

- f_eq ≈ 2.42e-04 Hz → 2.42e-03 Hz  (≈ 0.24–2.4 mHz)

## Guardrail

These “equivalent frequencies” are **unit-conversion glue**. They’re useful for communication and plotting across channels, but they are **not** evidence by themselves.
